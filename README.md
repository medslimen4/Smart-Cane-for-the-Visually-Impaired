<h3>Description :</h3>
<br>
The Smart Cane for the Visually Impaired is a device designed to assist individuals with visual impairments in navigating their environment. The cane is equipped with vibration and audio feedback to alert the user to obstacles or potential hazards in their path. The cane uses ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles and provide the user with real-time feedback through the handle of the cane. The cane also includes a built-in audio device that can provide verbal directions and announce the distance to nearby obstacles. The cane is lightweight and easy to use, making it a practical and valuable tool for individuals with visual impairments.

<h3>Objectif:</h3>
The objective of this project is to design and develop a Smart Cane for the Visually Impaired that will provide individuals with visual impairments with an additional level of support and safety when navigating their environment. The cane aims to help users detect and avoid obstacles that may not be visible to them, and provide verbal directions that help them to find their way. The cane will also provide real-time feedback through the handle, which will help users to identify potential hazards. Overall, the goal of this project is to create a device that will empower individuals with visual impairments to move more confidently, safely and independently in their daily lives.
